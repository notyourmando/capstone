# WDI Capstone - Chicago Farmers Markets and Growers

### Objective
Create an app that maps out all the Chicago Farmers Markets. The app is intended to locate your position and inform you of which market is closest to you. In my the next version of the app, I would like to incorporate an area where users can register what fruits and vegetables they're growing in there own backyards. This would allow growers to communicate with each other and possibly trade produce.

### Technologies Used
- Jade
- Node
- Express
- MongoDB
- Angular (Soon)

### Approach Taken
Since I needed more practice with backend and the full stack in general, I decided to go through the Getting MEAN book to better familiarize myself with the content.

### Installation Instructions
- NPM Install
- Run NODEMON

### Unsolved Problems
- I got the database created, but wasn't able to getting it connecting correctly.
- I was also not able to get the geolocator working.
- Angular still needs to be implemented.
- Nasal conjestion is still a problem.
